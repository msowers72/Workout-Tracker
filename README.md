## Description:
Today, the global gym industry has an estimated worth of over $96.7 billion dollars, 
and there are over 37,000 fitness applications, available in the Google Play store.
I've created a very simple and free fitness application that will allow users to track,
two different types of workouts. 

## Usage
As a user, I will be able to track my daily cardio and resistance workouts.
The application tracks, the name, type, weight, sets, reps and the duration of
your exercises.
